1. INTRODUCTION
This file contains the instructions for installing Sukiyaki.
At this point in time, installing Sukiyaki is not as easy as the authors would
like. If you know how and would like to help simplify the process, contact 
Anthony at <anro@acm.org>.
It is recommended to read the entire document before installing Sukiyaki.


2. PREREQUISITES
Sukiyaki requires:
	*	Python 2.6 or later (but not 3.0 or later)
	*	Django 1.2 or later
	*	Python Imaging Library (PIL) 1.1.6 or later
	*	An HTTP-server with FastCGI or WSGI support.
It's outside the scope of this document to explain how to install and
configure the prerequisites. Please consult the appropriate 
documentation on their websites.
Sukiyaki will run on Windows or Linux.

If installing for development purposes, you will need the above except
for the HTTP-server. 


3. INSTALLATION
While the simplest would be to copy the entire Sukiyaki source to your FastCGI
directory and run it, we highly discourage that as it introduces some security
issues. For development, it's not a problem.

	3.1	- Create a new Django project (more directions in Django's userguide)
		/path/to/python/scripts/django-admin.py startproject sukiyaki
		
		Into the sukiyaki folder just created, copy the imageboard/ and
		templates/ directories.
		
	3.2	- Configure your Sukiyaki install's settings
		Open the settings.py from our source in a text editor and open the
		settings.py created by the startproject command in another text editor.
		If doing development, you can just copy all our project files into your
		project directory without any extra configuration required.
		
		Copy over the PROJECT_ROOT variable. This is very important and makes
		our code much easier to write. This requires import os. So add 
		an import os statement at the beginning of the file.
		
		If doing a server install, set the variable DEBUG to false. Otherwise,
		when there is a crash, users will get a huge stack trace and also info
		about the server configuration that could have malicious uses.
		
		Configure your database engine. If using SQLite, you can copy our
		database configuration. For development, SQLite is simplest.
		
		Set your MEDIA_ROOT and MEDIA_URL variables.
		
		Enable the Session Middleware in MiddlewareClasses. We need it for
		some of our features.
		
		Copy our TEMPLATE_DIRS setting.
		
		Finally, add 'django.contrib.admin' and 'sukiyaki.imageboard' to the
		list of installed apps.
		
	3.3	- Set up urls.py
		Copy our urls.py in the project root into your project root. If you
		have multiple sites installed and need to put all of Sukiyaki's urls
		under their own folder, edit the regex for the imageboard app.
		
	3.4	- Initialize the Sukiyaki database
		In your project directory, run the command
		python manage.py syncdb
		This will create the tables used by Sukiyaki and set you up as admin.
		You're now ready to use Sukiyaki!
		
		
4.	TWEAK
If you don't like the URLs that sukiyaki uses by default for the boards and posts,
you can edit them in the urls.py file in the imageboard directory.
